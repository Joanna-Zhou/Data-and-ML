# Data-and-ML
Machine Learning projects without the use of any ML libraries.

Projects in the order of time (old -> recent):
* __kNN__: 
  * k-Nearest Neighbours method used on both and classification
  * Includes a comparison with linear regression
  * Includes a comparison of different methods to improve time-efficiency
* __GLM__: 
  * Generalized Linear Model
  * Used different generalized functions and their corresponding kernels to fit the Mauna_loa dataset
  * Compared the time-efficiency using primary vs. dual representation
* __GD-SGD__:
  * Playing around with different configurations of Gradient Descent and Stochastic GD
* __NN__:
  * Built a 2-layer neural network from scratch to train on the Mnist_small dataset
  * Visualized the most heavily-weighed parameters in the first hidden layer
  * Compared the accuracy of training vs. validation set (i.e. learning curve)
  * Observed the ones that are "not confident" vs. those that are predicted incorrectly
 * __Bayesian__:
   * Implemented Bayesian inference with various approximation methods including Laplace and MCMC Sampling
   * For each method, compared different configurations
  
Please see the _.ipynb_ files for the code and demo. Each project also has a report in the _report_ folder.
